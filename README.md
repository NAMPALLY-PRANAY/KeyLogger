## 📖 Overview
This is a simple **Python keylogger** that uses the [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library to monitor and log keystrokes.  
It is lightweight, cross-platform, and designed for controlled environments like:  

- Cybersecurity research & training  
- Parental monitoring (with consent)  
- Personal productivity tracking
